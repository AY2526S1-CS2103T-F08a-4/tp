* This is **ParentConnect**, a tool to link up students, parents and teachers targeted at kindergarten students especially.<br>
  Example usages:
  * find parent contact information easily
  * organize student information such as dietary restrictions, accomodations and grades
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[ParentConnect Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
